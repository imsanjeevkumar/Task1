Let me explain the files I have created:

Dockerfile:

Uses Python 3.9 slim image
Copies application files
Installs required Python packages
Exposes port 5000
Sets up environment variables
Configures how to run the Flask application

.env file:

Contains environment-specific configurations
Sets MongoDB connection URI
Configures Flask environment settings
Provides a template for additional configurations


Docker Compose file:

Defines two services: web (Flask app) and mongodb
Sets up networking between services
Configures volume for persistent MongoDB data
Maps ports and sets environment variables
Enables development-friendly setup with volume mounting


Requirements file:

Lists Python package dependencies
Specifies specific versions for consistent builds

To use these files:

Save your original Flask app as app.py
Place these files in the same directory
Run docker-compose up --build

This setup provides:

Containerized Flask application
MongoDB database
Easy local development environment
Persistent data storage
Network isolation
